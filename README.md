##StreetWise

StreetWise is an app that provides walking directions that take your environment into account. StreetWise generates a number of possible routes from point A to point B and uses SFGov crime data from the last 3 months to rank and select the "safest" one.

StreetWise is currently limited to the SF Metro Area. iOS and Android apps coming soon.
